Android App Project for my Software Engineering and Project Work IN2000 class at the University of Oslo.

The app enables airplane enthusiasts and curious users to primarily see live data about planes in the sky and weather at airports. 
Design for the app was done by surveying potential users and rapid prototyping. 
* The dashboard tab is an overview of the airports in Norway, displaying weather statistics and information for each of them (see picture below)
* The maps tab interactive map page which shows the location of each flight over Norway in real time, with insightful information displayed upon tapping a plane, or airport on the map (see picture below).
