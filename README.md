The app allows airplane enthusiasts and curious users to see several things. 
## 1. See a dashboard of airports in Norway which displays weather statistics and information at them.
## 2. An interactive map page which shows the location of each flight over Norway in real time, with insightful information displayed upon tapping a plane, or airport on the map.
